# FFmpeg Video Assembly

## Workflow

1. Inspect inputs with `ffprobe`.
2. Normalize dimensions, frame rate, codecs, and sample rates before concat when needed.
3. Use concat demuxer only when inputs match; otherwise transcode through filtergraph.
4. Overlay graphics/captions from HyperFrames outputs.
5. Export high-quality H.264 MP4 to `renders/final.mp4`.
6. Keep intermediate files in `raw-media/assembled/`.

## Required Log

Write exact commands used to `renders/render-log.md`, including:

- input paths
- normalization commands
- concat list path
- overlay/filtergraph command
- final export command
- warnings or compromises
