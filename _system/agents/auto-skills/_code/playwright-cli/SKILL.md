# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Quick start

```bash
# open a browser
playwright-cli open https://example.com

# inspect the page and interact using snapshot refs
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
playwright-cli screenshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Repo-specific command paths

### App-only debugging

Use the repo wrapper to attach to the running shared Chrome profile:

```bash
pnpm chrome:debug
pnpm playwright-cli
pnpm playwright-cli -- open http://app.localhost:3000
pnpm playwright-cli -- -s=impression-agent-123 open http://app.localhost:3000
pnpm playwright-cli -- --auth-export open http://app.localhost:3000
pnpm playwright-cli:shared -- open http://app.localhost:3000
```

The `--auth-export` flow reuses the Playwright cookie export for app/session state. Live LinkedIn behavior still needs the already-running shared Chrome profile.

## Extension debugging rules for this repo

When debugging an extension issue, inspect all relevant surfaces before changing code:

1. popup
2. app bridge on `app.localhost:3000`
3. LinkedIn content-script surface

Typical extension workflow:

```bash
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli network
```

playwright-cli open
playwright-cli open https://example.com/

## Notes

- Runtime wrapper configs are generated under `.playwright/cli.*.runtime.json`
- `pnpm playwright-cli` and `pnpm playwright-cli:shared` default to the repo-scoped shared Chrome attach flow
- `pnpm playwright-cli:extension` uses the shared extension/debug profile
- Use `--auth-export` for isolated manual runs, and keep Playwright tests on exported auth state
- Use snapshots first when exploring unfamiliar UI
- Prefer unique `-s=` session names for agent work
