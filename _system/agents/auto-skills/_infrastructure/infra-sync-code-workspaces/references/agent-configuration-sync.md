## Fleet agent configuration sync

This is the only source of truth for distributing personal Codex and Claude Code configuration from the registered primary to reviewed fleet machines. Initial onboarding and normal Code workspace reconciliation use the same script and contract.

### Ownership

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| Machine identity, role, platform, home, transport, eligibility | `$infra-code-folder-and-computer-topology` registry |
| Repositories and personal agent configuration convergence | `$infra-sync-code-workspaces` |
| New-machine gate ordering | `$infra-onboard-machine` |
| Worker-Mac applications, GUI consent, and unattended-operation checks | `$infra-onboard-machine` worker-Mac route |
| tmux, workmux, Warp, cmux, and terminal profiles | `$infra-manage-fleet-terminal-workspaces` |
| Versioned global instructions and local projection | `_system/agents/config` and `vault skills sync` |
| Repo-owned skill selection and global projection | `vault skills sync` |

Other repositories own only their local `.agents/skills` sources. The Vault repository owns which of those skills are projected globally and owns all fleet-distribution policy.

### Managed configuration

The Vault source and primary home settings are authoritative:

| Source | Target | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `_system/agents/config/AGENTS.md` + machine-role template + private registry | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | Versioned personal instructions with rendered machine context |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | `~/.codex/config.toml` | Primary settings and raw `[mcp_servers.*]`, with the primary home path rebased; target-local `[plugins.*]` and `[marketplaces.*]` are preserved |
| Rendered `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Relative symlink, so personal instructions have one output |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | All user settings, with the primary home path rebased to the target home |

Machine footers identify the current role, enabled peers, WireGuard service addresses, Mattbook-facing preview rules, and configured GUI access. Wootbook noVNC guidance uses the recorded active Mattbook loopback URL when available, otherwise tells the agent to establish and return the actual URL; port `61152` is illustrative only.

For a macOS worker, the rendered Codex config enforces `approval_policy = "never"`, `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`, and `[mcp_servers.computer-use] enabled = true`. All other primary settings remain intact. These are target-role overlays, not a second configuration source.

Authentication, OAuth state, sessions, logs, caches, memories, trust databases outside `config.toml`, macOS privacy grants, and Claude's `~/.claude.json` never sync. Inline credential-like `env` values and credential-bearing URLs fail closed before any target mutation. Store shared secrets through their owning env/SOPS workflow and authenticate each machine locally.

Plugin tables are not ordinary configuration. The Codex CLI owns them on each host, while [[plugin-reconciliation|Fleet Codex Plugin Reconciliation]] derives portable desired state from Mattbook and converges installations after repository reconciliation. Primary marketplace timestamps, revisions, cache roots, and runtime paths are never copied into a target config.

### When it runs

`bootstrap`, `reconcile`, and `refresh` preview or apply agent configuration for every selected eligible target. `doctor` verifies it. The explicit onboarding form accepts one disabled reviewed target with `--provision-disabled`; ordinary runs require enabled targets with `global_agents_eligible: true`.

This is convergence on each normal sync run, not a background daemon. `vault skills sync` performs the same instruction rendering locally on a Vault-capable Mac. Changes made in generated home files are backed up and replaced by the versioned source on the next apply. Each changed target path receives an adjacent UTC-stamped backup before atomic replacement.

### Commands

Normal repository and configuration convergence:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(vault root)/_system/agents/auto-skills/_infrastructure/infra-sync-code-workspaces"
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_code_workspaces.py" reconcile --target MACHINE
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_code_workspaces.py" reconcile --target MACHINE --apply
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_code_workspaces.py" doctor --target MACHINE
```

Configuration-only diagnosis or repair:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_agent_configuration.py" --target MACHINE
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_agent_configuration.py" --target MACHINE --apply
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync_agent_configuration.py" --target MACHINE --verify
```

During onboarding, add `--provision-disabled` to the explicit target command. After Code reconciliation, run `vault skills sync --apply`; on a Vault-capable Mac, require `vault skills sync --dry-run --require-repo-sources`. Linux workers verify repository-owned skills inside their reconciled repositories and never receive the Vault solely for skill projection.

### Compatibility and rollback

The topology command owns the current registry schema and its migrations. Sync consumers accept any positive integer registry `schema_version` and validate only the fields they use, so an additive registry migration does not break them. A removed or incompatible required field still fails with its exact missing-field error.

To roll back one target file, stop Codex and Claude Code on that machine, restore the chosen adjacent `.backup-<UTC>` path, then rerun configuration preview. Never copy authentication or session files as part of rollback.
